# Naive React boilerplate

* Simple, but effective code structure. Targeting coding CRUD block in few days.
* Based on Create React App
* Zustand as state manager targeting all business logic placed in stores
* Use store per domain and store slicing for multi-file decomposing
* React Hook From + zod for forms
* React Router for routing
* PrimeReact as basis for UI
* Utility-css for markup

## TODO

* Integrate zustand with React Router
* i18n
* Tests with Playwright
